A total amaze "3d" engine for Dreamcast
-------------------------------------

So to get started using this "engine" you first gotta get the KOS shit all setup. This took me awhile but here's what I did:

1. Follw this setup first: http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=102800#p1041492
2. After that fails right at the end follow this: http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=103033&hilit=gcc

Also this is assuming you're using cygwin on windows 7.
